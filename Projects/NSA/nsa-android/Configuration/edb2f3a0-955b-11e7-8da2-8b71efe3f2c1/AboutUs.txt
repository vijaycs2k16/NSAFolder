<b>Universal High School</b>, a wing of Sri Sai Educational Society, was the brain child of Sri Radha Krishna Murthy, fondly known as R.K. Master who by seeing the plight of parents, who were in a dilemma as to where to send their children for good education, decided to alleviate their problems, and finally decided to start an Educational Institution which would cater to the all-round development of the kids hailing from Daggubadu and the surrounding villages.</br></br> Sri R. K. Master has a long stint of 34 years as a lecturer and has the welfare of the children at heart. He is a visionary and a philanthropist with long term plans for the welfare of the children. Taking cognizance of the needs of the parents, Universal High School opened its doors to the children of the parents who craved to give their kids the kind of education which they or their near ones could only dream of.</br></br> The school is managed by a committee with Sri. Satish Chandra, M Tech, at the helm. Under his efficient stewardship, the school has made tremendous progress in a span of just seven years and has scaled the heights of success on all fronts, i.e. Scholastic, CoScholastic, etc. The spectacular success of our SSC students speaks volumes of the concerted efforts of our "Team Universal".</br></br> He insists on nothing less than perfection, and clamours the same from both the staff and students. Taking into account the ever changing global scenario in Science and Technology and the innovative methods being adapted by the top institutions Of the national and international arenas, UHS adopted such measures to see that the kids are given the best possible education and to churn out a creamy layer in the society.</br></br> Since the surrounding villages are inhabited by parents, most of whom have minimal education and were at a loss as where to send their kids for an education that would help their children to cope and compete with students of corporate school, UHS came to their rescue.</br></br> Ours is always a multifaceted approach towards our children.
UHS is preparing the children in such a way that they will be able to meet any challenges that the fast moving Scientific and Technological world may pose.</br></br>
