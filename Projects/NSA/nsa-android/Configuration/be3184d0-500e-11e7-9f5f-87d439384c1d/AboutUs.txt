Auxilium English Medium School was founded in 1992 by the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians commonly known as the Salesian Sisters of Don Bosco. It is a minority institution established and administered by them primarily for the education of the Catholic Community. But the members of other communities are also admitted irrespective of case and creed and their rights of conscience are respected.

The School follows the educative system of Don Bosco based on reason, religion and loving-kindness, where the pupil is the protagonist of his/her own formation. The Educative Community consisting of parents, teachers, pupils and management work together for the ‘holistic’ development of the pupil in a family atmosphere.
