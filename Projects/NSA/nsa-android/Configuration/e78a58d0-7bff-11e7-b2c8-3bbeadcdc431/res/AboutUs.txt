We believe that a congenial environment is vital for an effective teaching - learning process to take place. We will create such a conducive atmosphere by making the welfare of the child our top priority.

While academic excellence will be our primary focus, our curriculum will be so designed as to develop the physical, mental, emotional, aesthetic, social and spiritual dimensions of the child's personality thus making him/her confident to face the challenges of the future.

We also believe that a value-based education is of paramount importance in achieving the goals of education. Therefore the inculcation of such values like compassion, sharing, honesty, concern for the weaker sections of society especially of those in our own neighborhood and care for the environment will form the CORE of all our endeavors.

Consequently, an ideal "PATRICIAN" will be a Prayerful, Affectionate, Trustworthy, Responsible, Inspirational, Courageous, Intelligent, Attentive and Noble citizen of our great motherland.
