The <b>COLONEL HILL ENGLISH HIGH SCHOOL</b> was established in July 1964 with a view to cater to the educational needs of the children of financially weak parents.</br></br>The school started with nursery and kindergarten classes and has now classes upto Std X. Today, the school strength has grown to 1000 students and still growing. We are proud to state that thousands of boys & girls of our school are educated and are successful in life.</br></br>We have a number of underprivileged children who are unable to pay their regular school fees. At the beginning of every academic year there is an increase in the number of poor, needy & deserving students.</br></br>The school has set up scholarship funds to support 250 children and we can assure you no child has been deprived of this valuable asset of education. In addition, 150 deserving students are being fed with nutritious, free, and fresh mid-day meals.</br></br>
